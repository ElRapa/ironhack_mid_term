# Midterm Project

## 1 Overview:

#### 1.1 Team:
- Emma (E)
- Hong (H)
- Raphael (R)

#### 1.2 Topic:
**Life Expectancy**
##### 1.2.1 Objective:
- Build model that will predict the life expectancy based on features provided in the dataset
- Explore which factors are responsible for higher life expectancy
- Give recommendations to improve life expectancy in specific countries
###### Adressed Questions: 
    - Does various predicting factors which has been chosen initially really affect the Life expectancy? What are the predicting variables actually affecting the life expectancy?
    - Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(<65) increase its healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan?
    - How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?
    - Does Life Expectancy has positive or negative correlation with eating habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol etc.
    - What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?
    - Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol?
    - Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy?
    - What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy?

##### 1.2.2 Data:
Collected by World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN).
The final dataset consists of 22 columns (20 predicting variables) and 2938 row containing data collected from the year 2000-2015 of 193 countries.
All predicting variables were divided into the following broad categories:
- Immunization related factors
- Mortality factors
- Economical factors
- Social factors
